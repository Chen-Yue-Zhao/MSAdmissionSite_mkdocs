## Personal  Impression
**CMU, as far as I know, is where one of the best School of Computer Science locates.** Focusing on CS and Eng. part, the school’s program has a high standard in both admission and graduate 	requirement. As for master program, the traditional CS programs like MSCS are the hottest but also the most challenging ones.

**Anyone applying should be the best in CS undergraduate program, or show their extraordinary expertise and talent in CS if they are a CS undergraduate.**

Hard to apply for as it is, CMU provides **a variety of graduate programs for diverse applicants**. Each one of them has different level of difficulty to get in. You may encounter obstacle in extinguish multiple programs. **Here I provided links about links of program guides in [SCS](https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/academics/guide-to-graduate-degrees-and-programs/school-of-computer-science.html) and [CE](https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/academics/guide-to-graduate-degrees-and-programs/college-of-engineering.html#Information%20Networking%20Institute).**
