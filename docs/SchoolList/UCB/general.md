## Personal Description
UC Berkeley is definitely one of the top school in EECS area. The school is known for its strong science and engineering atmosphere. This quality can be seen from their admission requirements of EECS (Meng. here). Welcome to “career changers” as it would be, Berkeley is looking forward to manifestation of your competence in their so-called “challenging program” from your background experience. This you need to make your background convincing you are capable of handling their program.
